# # Build blackjack For level 1 include at least 2 players(you and the computer.) 
# You should include the hit(deal another card) or stand(don't deal another card) 
# The dealer(the computer) should make it's own decision as to when it should hit and when it should stand. 
# So you shouldn't be inputting hit or stand for it. 
# Your app should declare a winner as soon as someone reaches 21, someone exceeds 21(they lose), or if both you and the computer stand.

#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!STILL NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO A K Q and Jack!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
